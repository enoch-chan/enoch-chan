	<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
	<br>
	<p> Here are some tips and tricks to help make the most of your visit to the Christmas markets!</p>

	<br>

	<h2>Our top tips</h2>

	<p>
		<b>1. Arrive early and avoid peak hours</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		Christmas markets tend not to be as crowded early on in the season when there are fewer tourists. Avoid midday, which tends to be the busiest hour, and weekends, if you do not want to be caught up in a crowd. Be mindful of closing dates to avoid missing out, as some may close a few days before Christmas.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>2. Bring Cash </b>
		<br>
		<br>
		Cash is often the only accepted payment method at stalls so it is wise to remember to bring enough to cover food and other goods. Coming prepared with cash also allows you to beat lengthy queues at the ATM and spend that time enjoying the food, drinks and other festive delights!
